# Thalassophile

## 🤔 Why the name **Thalassophile**

Thalassophile means a lover of the sea.

## 💡 Inspiration

Since the theme of the hackathon was Blahaj himself, we chose to do a project that was more lighthearted. So we build a site where people can not only know about the sea animals, but also view and interact with the 3D models and imitate them into real world using AR (Augmented Reality) technology.

## 💻 What it does

Thalassophile exhibits various sea animals (specially Sharks), elucidate their features and imitate them into real world using AR (Augmented Reality) technology.

## ⚙️ How it works

- User need to Log In/Sign Up
- User can choose from various sea animals
- After selecting the sea animal user can interact with the 3D model by changing its orientation or zooming in or out.
- User can explore more about the sea animal by clicking on it, such as if you click on the fin of the shark it will give a short description about that
- User can also view all the sea animals in AR (Augmented Reality)

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

One challenging part was how to implement the AR and rendering the 3D models using react-three-fiber, and it took a while to learn and figure out how to make it work properly in the website. 

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are happy that we completed the project in this short frame of time and we learned a lot from this hackathon

## 📖 What we learned

How to use Three Js, and collaboration.

## 🚀 What's next for Thalassophile

- Adding more languages
- Add more 3D models
